q: The questions in this scale ask you about your feelings and thoughts during the last week.<br>
In each case, you will be asked <i>how often</i> you felt or thought a certain way.<br>
Although some of the questions are similar, there are differences
between them and you should treat each one as a separate question.<br>
The best approach is answer each question fairly quickly.<br>
That is, don't try to count up the number of times you felt a particular way,<br>
but rather indicate the alternative that seems like a reasonable estimate.<br>
